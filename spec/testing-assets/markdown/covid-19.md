###Check your symptoms

If you or anyone in your household have any COVID-19 symptoms, you must not arrange any sales, purchases or swaps on the Online Marketplace. The same applies for situations when you’re self isolating or are in a quarantine.

###Do not enter people's houses when making the transactiosaidjfasiojfas

Instead, wait outside 2 meters away from the doorstep, let the seller bring the item and leave it outside the door, wait for them to go back inside and then collect the item. The same applies for delivering any items. If you’re not comfortable sharing your home address with the other party and the item is small and easily transportable, you can meet at a public space (while maintaining the 2 meters distance).

###Stay 2 meters apart

When collecting or delivering items, stay 2 meters away from the other person.

###Wear a face mask

When you approach another person when collecting or delivering items, always wear a face mask and ideally also use a hand sanitiser when exchanging any items.

###One person only

Only one person should approach a house to collect an item. If you are with more people, they should stand back/stay in the car while the collection is being made.

###Clean and disinfect items

Clean and disinfect any item that you intend to sell/swap. If you buy or swap an item, make sure that you clean it before bringing it into your home and as always - wash your hands!
